# 📘 Final Year Project — Obtaining Coherent Configurations on Non-Distance Regular Graphs

This project explores the structure of **coherent configurations** derived from graph operations applied to known strongly regular graphs. It focuses on identifying algebraic closures through matrix operations and 2-dimensional Weisfeiler–Leman refinement, with applications in combinatorial design and spectral graph theory.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Given a strongly regular graph (SRG), can we obtain a minimal coherent configuration by applying:

- Vertex deletion
- Seidel switching
- Edge switching (especially on block graphs from orthogonal arrays)?

The goal was to observe **how far such graphs are from being association schemes**, and whether their **coherent closure** stabilizes into identifiable algebraic patterns.

---

## 🔍 Key Concepts

- **Coherent Configuration**: A partition of the edge set (including self-loops) satisfying closure under composition and adjacency.
- **Weisfeiler-Leman Algorithm (2-WL)**: A refinement method for graph colorings that helps detect non-isomorphism and builds matrix closures.
- **Wielandt’s Principle**: A tool to confirm minimality of the generated algebra from adjacency matrices.

---

## 🔬 Methods

1. Constructed initial graphs from known SRGs:
   - Rook graphs $R(n,k)$
   - Triangular graphs $T(n)$

2. Applied operations:
   - Vertex deletion
   - Seidel switching
   - Block edge-switching using OA(2, n)

3. Computed adjacency matrices and applied closure under multiplication using SageMath.

4. Verified coherent rank using:
   - Manual combinatorial tracking
   - Implementation of WL-refinement algorithm (k-dim) in C++

5. Validated closure with explicit applications of **Wielandt’s Principle**.

---

## 🧩 Key Observations

- For block graphs from **orthogonal arrays OA(2, n)**:
  - Edge switching consistently yielded a **coherent rank of 15**
  - Type matrices had a **stable block diagonal structure**:
    - Diagonal 1: \( n-1 \) blocks of type \( I \) and \( J - I \)
    - Diagonal 2: fibres with \( J - I_{n-1} \) and 0

- Switching on rook graphs disrupted symmetry, but algebraic closure retained regularity under WL refinement.
